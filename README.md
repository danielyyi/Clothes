NewThreads

Website to help find new clothes from startup brands, 2025
NewThreads (findnewthreads.com) is a website designed to help shoppers easily find startup clothing brands and to give these brands a platform for more exposure. Like my previous full-stack app, this one is being build using React.js, Node.js, Apollo, GraphQL, and MongoDB. However, the scale and number of features for this project is much greater and while I am using a lot of the same tools, I really pushed myself in terms of learning new MongoDB syntax and handling frontend logic.
